This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render items that are unexpectedly null or undefined.  This frequently happens when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the data hasn't loaded yet, or if there's an issue in your data processing logic.

```javascript
// Buggy component
<FlatList
  data={this.state.items}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

If `this.state.items` is `null` or contains elements where `item.name` is undefined, you'll get a runtime error.  The error message might not be directly helpful, making it tricky to debug.
