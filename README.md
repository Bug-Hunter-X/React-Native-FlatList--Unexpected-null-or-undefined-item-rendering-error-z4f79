# React Native FlatList: Handling Null or Undefined Items

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component and its solution. The error occurs when rendering items that are unexpectedly null or undefined, often due to asynchronous data fetching or data manipulation problems.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file shows a FlatList attempting to render items that might be null or undefined, resulting in a runtime error.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to prevent the error. It uses conditional rendering to only render items that are properly defined.  It also handles the loading state effectively to avoid the error while the data is fetching.
